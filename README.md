## Community developed plugins and helpers

- [Mini OSC for COGS](https://github.com/guigro/cogs-mini-osc) - a little [OSC (Open Sound Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) server in Python (using Flask); since COGS supports OSC I/O natively, you can (ab)use it as a general interface to your own code (not just for sound!)
